# Track your steps here
## Preparation
1. `git clone` to copy the project we're working on
2. `git remote add origin <myrepo>` created a repo on GitHub
3. `git checkout -b vlad/project` created branch where we'll be working
4. `git add .` add all we have to our field
5. `git commit -m "Comment what have we done"`
6. `git push origin vlad/project` sent all on my new GitHub repo
p.s. `git status` helps us track our progress
